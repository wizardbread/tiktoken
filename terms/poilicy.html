        <h2>How Long We Store Personal Data</h2>
    
        <p>User data will be stored until the purpose the data was collected for has been achieved. You will be notified if your data is kept for longer than this period.</p>
    
        <h2>How We Protect Your Personal Data</h2>
    
        <p>All processed and collected data is publicly available information, such as social media handles, Web3 wallet addresses, and the signature combining these two pieces of publicly available data. As such, no sensitive data is ever collected. While we take all reasonable precautions to ensure that user data is secure and that users are protected, there always remains the risk of harm. The Internet as a whole can be insecure at times, and therefore we are unable to guarantee the security of user data beyond what is reasonably practical.</p>
    
        <h2>Automated Decision-Making and Profiling</h2>
    
        <p>You have a right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning you or similarly significantly affects you. You can object to your personal data being used in this way or require a manual review of an automated decision by contacting our data protection officer. We only use automated decision-making and profiling if the decision:</p>
    
        <p>1. Is necessary to enter into or perform a contract between you and us;</p>
        <p>2. Is authorized by EU or member state law to which we are subject and which also lays down suitable measures to safeguard your rights and freedoms and legitimate interests; or</p>
        <p>3. Is based on your explicit consent.</p>
    
        <p>The decision(s) we make using automated decision-making, the criteria or reasons those decisions are based on, and the significance and consequences of those decisions for you are as follows:</p>
    
        <p>1. Decision: If a request is likely fraudulent.</p>
        <p>   Criteria or reasons for decision: IP address and number of registrations.</p>
        <p>   Significance and consequences of decision for you: The user will be restricted from registering too many accounts from the same IP in short periods.</p>
    
        <h2>Your Rights as a User</h2>
    
        <p>Under the GDPR, you have the following rights:</p>
    
        <p>1. Right to be informed;</p>
